## What is this?
as the name implies this is a docker container orchestrator made in go
I made this following this [book](https://www.manning.com/books/build-an-orchestrator-in-go-from-scratch) 

## Why?
I wanted to learn about Kubernetes and how it works

## This should be used in production?
I would not recommend using this on production systems

## Any Docs?
the cli is documented, just run the help command

## features
- round robin and one implementation of epvm as scheduling options
